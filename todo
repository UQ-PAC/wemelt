-debug - handling undefined variables in SMT? figure out whether to negate cond or not
-user defining P, Gamma at start
-organise expression class - boolean expression subclass
-bitwise in SMT - ensure conversion works properly - test thoroughly
-make match paper syntax more closely

eventually:
clean up, comment more extensively
fix up vardef stuff
arrays
bitwise arithmetic instead of int arithmetic?
make while rule more powerful?
