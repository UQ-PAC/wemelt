-make output nicer
-test - D' in while especially
-organise expression class - boolean expression subclass & clean up operations
-bitwise in SMT - ensure conversion works properly - test thoroughly
-define security as case class not boolean to make code easier to understand

tests for
-D' isnt subset of D
-D' isnt subset of D''

eventually:
make sure everything is commented clearly
arrays?
bitwise arithmetic instead of int arithmetic?

output ideas:
-maybe store errors in state, go through them at the end, add line numbers?
