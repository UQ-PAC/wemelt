bare minimum necessary for AssignL rule
-fix parsing prime variables in R/G
-R automation stuff
-P + R
-{P, Gamma + R }
-low_or_eq
--either L_R(x) true in current state so x's classification doesn't change
--or x's classification trivially unmodified due to R preventing x from being written to
-P stability check
-Gamma stability check
--update substitution to handle variable to expression

for later
-quantification in predicates?
-updated gamma - predicates instead of values, changed evaluation
