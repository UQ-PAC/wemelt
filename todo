make quantification happen on outside of implies
fix introducing temporary variables

-make P_inv optional in parsing
-remove unnecessary SMT calls in R-var part of P + R ?? - check this ??
-SMT optimisations to reduce calls in a few places
-test everything!!!
-fix gamma invariant problem with new P structure

for later
-make r_var implementation better?
-quantification in predicates?
-check rely & guarantee don't evaluate to false initially
