BIL stuff
-use mapping of labels to size of their contents in State to convert labels into vars in predicates
-need to determine type of any expression assigned to a Temp



-make P_inv optional in parsing
-remove unnecessary SMT calls in R-var part of P + R ?? - check this ??
-SMT optimisations to reduce calls in a few places
-test everything!!!

new weak memory model:
-figure out how to calculate D Fixed Point now that it is dependent on P
-optimise by only testing those variables not in the sets to compare to in AssignG
-fix gamma initialising domain issue?
done:
-I and U updates
-P restrict ind
-D updates in rules
-D subset checks
-P restrict u checks
-u and i calculations
-D fixed point calculation
-all assignG checks
-convert G to being Gvar
-modified P + (R, i) update
-modified gamma update

for later
-make r_var implementation better?
-quantification in predicates?
-check rely & guarantee don't evaluate to false initially
