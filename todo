-make output nicer
-test - D' in while especially
-organise expression class - boolean expression subclass & clean up operations
-bitwise in SMT - ensure conversion works properly - test thoroughly
-verbose option to print out state before/after each operation
-debug option to print out more
-switch variables for OR CNF to reduce complexity

tests for
-D' isnt subset of D - remove from D outside loop, add to D inside loop
-D' isnt subset of D''
-multiple layers of if/while

eventually:
make sure everything is commented clearly
arrays?
bitwise arithmetic instead of int arithmetic?
