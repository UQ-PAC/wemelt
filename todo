implement loop invariants
work on execution:
-fix updating P for assigns
-if rule - finish merging Ps
-converting propositions to CNF
-figure out operation data structure/expand expression class as needed
-fix binding for exists - need to define bound variables as separate
-fix up logical operators
-remove remnants of function definitions, types

eventually:
using SMT solver
arrays?
user defining P? D? Gamma?
