-make P_inv optional in parsing
-remove unnecessary SMT calls in R-var part of P + R ?? - check this ??
-SMT optimisations to reduce calls in a few places
-test everything!!!

-u and i calculations
-modified P + (R, i) update
-modified gamma update
-AssignG rule changes
-D fixed point calculation?
-D updates in rules
done:
-I and U updates
-P restrict ind

for later
-make r_var implementation better?
-quantification in predicates?
