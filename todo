bare minimum necessary for AssignL rule
-fix parsing vardefs
-R automation stuff
-P + R
-{P, Gamma + R }
-low_or_eq
--either L_R(x) true in current state so x's classification doesn't change
--or x's classification trivially unmodified due to R preventing x from being written to
-P stability check
-Gamma stability check
for AssignG rule
-updated falling check
-guar P
-t <:_P L_G(x)

for later
-quantification in L?
-updated gamma - predicates instead of values, changed evaluation
