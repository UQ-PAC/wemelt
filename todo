-test
-on error assume everything is valid afterwards to handle multiple errors?
-organise expression class - boolean expression subclass & clean up operations
-bitwise in SMT - ensure conversion works properly - test thoroughly
-comment everything
-profiling

tests for
-multiple layers of if/while

eventually:
arrays?
bitwise arithmetic instead of int arithmetic?
