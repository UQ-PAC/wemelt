-nice output
-test - D' in while especially
-line numbers
-organise expression class - boolean expression subclass
-bitwise in SMT - ensure conversion works properly - test thoroughly
-define security as case class not boolean to make code easier to understand

eventually:
clean up, comment more extensively
arrays?
bitwise arithmetic instead of int arithmetic?
